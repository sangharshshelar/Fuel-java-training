/*Exercise 5 â€” Reverse Order
Complete the program so that the numbers in the array appear in reversed order. You will need to
use the variable temp to do this.
Note: this is a harder exercise than you might guess. I sometimes put it on a midterm
examination, and some students get the question wrong.*/
